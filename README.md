<p id="description">This repository contains the code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Vehicle Manufacturing Dataset. The dataset comprises information on various vehicles including their manufacturing year mileage and price. Files Included: vehicle_manufacturing_dataset.csv: The raw dataset in CSV format containing relevant information on vehicle manufacturing year mileage and price. DATASET EDA .ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for conducting EDA on the dataset. README.md: This file providing a brief description of the repository and its contents.</p>
<p>Objective:
The objective of this EDA is to gain insights into the relationships and trends within the vehicle manufacturing dataset. By exploring the data, we aim to understand how factors such as manufacturing year and mileage impact vehicle prices. The analysis will also uncover any patterns, correlations, and outliers present in the data.</p>
<p><h2>EDA Steps:</h2><br>
Data Loading: The notebook starts by loading the vehicle manufacturing dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Data Cleaning: We check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset. If needed, we perform data cleaning operations to ensure data quality.
Data Exploration: This step involves conducting various statistical analyses, generating summary statistics, and visualizing data distributions using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
Correlation Analysis: We examine the correlations between manufacturing year, mileage, and price to understand the relationships among these variables.
Heatmap Visualization: To gain a comprehensive view of the dataset, we create a heatmap to visualize the pairwise correlations between different features.
Insights and Observations: Based on the EDA results, we provide meaningful insights and observations related to vehicle prices, age, and mileage trends.</p>
<p><h2>Usage:</h2><br>
To replicate the EDA process, execute the eda_notebook.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have Python and required libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) installed.<br>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2><br>
The EDA provides valuable insights into the vehicle manufacturing dataset, highlighting key relationships and trends. By understanding the factors influencing vehicle prices, stakeholders can make informed decisions related to pricing strategies, market positioning, and customer preferences.
